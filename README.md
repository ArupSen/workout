#workout

My home workout session. I have been doing this session since early 2014 and do it three times a week on a good week. This is to track how I'm progressing.

Git and GitHub isn't only for code you know.

##Update February 2018:
The changes that I've made are according to the following guidelines.
* Focus on quality rather than quantity i.e. good form
* Reduce reps and no going to failure
* Keep reps below 5
* Increase tension by tightening abs and glutes
* Increase rest time to at least 3 minutes
* Inspired by Pavel Tsatouline
