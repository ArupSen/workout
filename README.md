#workout

My home workout session. I have been doing this session since early 2014 and do it three times a week on a good week. This is to track how I'm progressing.

Git and GitHub isn't only for code you know.

##Update March 2017:
The changes that I've made are according to the following guidelines.
* Focus on quality rather than quantity i.e. good form
* Progressions i.e. from 4 reps up to 8
* When 8 reps can be performed with ease it's time move on
* Inspired by Calishenics bodyweight workouts
