**Greasing the Groove**
During the latter part of March and for April the idea is to work on dips and l-sit every day, multiple times a day. 2 dips and a 5 second l-sit on rings.

**Handstands**
As recommended in the Overcoming Gravity book one should work on handstands every day. To this end I have added them to my yoga routine.
